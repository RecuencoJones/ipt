<br />

This document outlines the product roadmap, containing ideas we'd like to see in the future.

-----

- Create an **iPipeTo** landing page;
- Support other interactive interfaces, e.g: [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts), [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer), [blessed](https://github.com/mscdex/neo-blessed), [kui](https://github.com/IBM/kui), etc;
- Add a full-screen interface (similar to fzf default interface)
- Add index-linked interface (see: [https://github.com/ruyadorno/ntl/issues/26](https://github.com/ruyadorno/ntl/issues/26))

## How to start

There are a few steps you can follow in order to help. The best way to start is look up on Issues marked with the [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/ruyadorno/ipt/labels/good%20first%20issue
).

Before start coding, you should open issues and discuss what/why/how you want to do contribute/help with the rest of the folks involved.

Have fun! :smile:
